dsh-graph is a plugin that organizes work into a "goal board". Available graph_* tools (52 total):

## Goal lifecycle
- graph_create_goal(title[, version][, type]) create a goal (enters backlog; with version, schedule it; type: feature/bug/task/improvement/patch/chore);
- graph_transition(goal, to[, reason]) transition status; lifecycle draft→planning→collecting→ready→in_progress→review→delivered, plus blocked (entering blocked requires reason);
- graph_archive_goal(goal) archive a goal (only draft/planning/delivered may be archived);
- graph_unarchive_goal(goal) unarchive a goal;
- graph_delete_goal(goal) delete an archived goal (including cards/attempts);
- graph_postpone_goal(goal[, reason]) postpone a goal (move back to backlog, set to draft);
- graph_rename_goal(goal, title) rename a goal.

## Goal content
- graph_amend_goal(goal, note[, append]) record revisions/human feedback; note is the revision note, append writes into the goal description;
- graph_set_description(goal, description) edit the goal description in place (empty clears it);
- graph_set_directive(goal, directive) set supplemental directive for the next attempt (empty clears it);
- graph_set_goal_tags(goal, tags[, base_tags][, force]) set tags (≤20; base_tags is the optimistic-concurrency baseline, force overwrites);
- graph_set_goal_type(goal, type) set type feature/bug/task/improvement/patch/chore;
- graph_move_goal(goal, to[, version]) move goal between backlog / standalone goals/ / version;
- graph_add_comment(goal, text) append a comment/feedback to the Comments section.
- graph_write_results(goal, attempt, text[, source][, actor]) manually write one attempt's completion summary (source=manual and the writer are recorded by default); **after a lightweight change with no subagent (chore/patch), or an attempt that captured no output, the supervisor must write it proactively** (zero LLM calls, same format/path/overwrite policy as auto capture);
- graph_refresh_results([goal][, goals][, content][, source][, llm][, force][, actor]) rewrite results.md (conclusion / changes and impact / criteria status / evidence references / key decisions / timeline / sources); `llm:true` dispatches the dedicated summarizer subagent (role=summarizer) to write what specifically changed, the impact surface and what deserves attention (source=llm, keyed by source_hash so an unchanged history never re-calls the LLM; force:true rewrites anyway; falls back to source=deterministic when unavailable); without content/llm the body is assembled from goal history with zero LLM calls; with content the caller-supplied body is used (manual for humans); the previous version is archived as results-archive-YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS.md; accepts a single goal or a goals[] batch (content is single-goal only) and reports written/skipped/failed/pending/cached per goal.

## Criteria · Cards · Attachments
- graph_set_criteria(goal, criteria[]) register quality criteria first (criteria precede execution; hard rule);
- graph_add_card(goal, title[, kind][, scope]) create a context card (shared by default; scope="goal" for owned);
- graph_fill_card(goal, card[, text][, content_ref][, summary]) fill card body (may reference @att/<name> for attachments; content_ref is legacy read-only);
- graph_review_card(goal, card) review a filled card (filled → reviewed);
- graph_delete_card(goal, card) delete a card (cannot delete while collecting);
- graph_convert_card_to_shared(goal, card) convert owned card → shared card;
- graph_convert_card_to_owned(goal, card) convert shared card → owned card (ref count must be 1);
- graph_attach_shared_card(goal, card) attach an existing shared card to a goal (reuse collected context, ref count +1, idempotent; owner/supervisor only);
- graph_detach_shared_card(goal, card) remove a goal's reference to a shared card (card stays in the pool; rejected while collecting; owner/supervisor only);
- graph_list_shared_cards() list the shared pool read-only (id/title/status/refs, without bodies);
- graph_store_attachment(name[, content][, base64]) store an attachment (text uses content, binary uses base64);
- graph_delete_attachment(name) delete an attachment (rejected if still referenced);
- graph_bind_collect_card(goal, card, child_id[, parent_session_id][, provider][, model]) bind a collection subagent to a card.

## Execution & Rework
- graph_start_attempt(goal[, card][, executor][, provider][, model][, reasoning_effort][, mode][, worktree][, attempt_brief][, task_type][, baseline_commit][, source_attempt][, acceptance_items]) dispatch an execution subagent;
- graph_record_attempt_handoff(goal, source_attempts[], failures, constraints, baseline, verification) supervisor records rework constraints;
- graph_unbind_goal_child(goal, {attempt|child_id}[, token][, reason][, legacy]) safely detach an execution subagent (token uses strict CAS; legacy bindings without a token require explicit legacy=true plus reason);
- graph_abandon_attempt(goal, attempt, reason) mark an attempt as abandoned;
- graph_resolve_accept(goal, verdict[, objection][, force][, reason][, fast_track][, machine_report]) supervisor resolves the acceptance request (accept/object); fast_track=true takes the machine fast path: policy must judge auto and machine_report must be all-green across the four gates (tests/typecheck exit_code=0, <150 product-code lines with no untracked files, all criteria ✅verified, computed by the engine), returning {ok, fast_track}.

## Validation & Reconciliation
- graph_validate() validate all invariants (status, ownership, criteria, dependency cycles, card references);
- graph_rebuild() rebuild state from event stream and reconcile with frontmatter.

## Memory management
- graph_memory_add(kind, text[, scope][, importance][, source_goal]) add a persistent memory (scope: on_demand default / standing for constant rules; source_goal links the source goal);
- graph_memory_replace(old, text[, kind][, importance][, source_goal]) correct existing memory (old locates, text is the new content, source_goal links the source goal);
- graph_memory_remove(old[, reason]) delete a memory entry (must confirm obsolete or withdrawn);
- graph_memory_recall([query][, kind][, limit]) search memories.

## Coordination & Handoff
- graph_handoff([query][, memory_limit]) session handoff (generates HANDOFF.md: board projection + memory + environment facts);
- graph_claim_supervisor() new session takes over as supervisor (idempotent, returns full HANDOFF).

## Worktree · Status · Settings
- graph_list_worktrees([goal]) list worktree cleanup candidates (read-only);
- graph_clean_worktree(id, confirm) clean a verified worktree (keeps branch by default);
- graph_report_status(goal, attempt, status[, state]) report attempt status (state: working/blocked/done/error, optional);
- graph_report_supervisor_status(status) supervisor reports status (board top status bar);
- graph_get_settings() read-only query of project config and valid enum metadata;
- graph_update_settings(patch) update project config (schema validation, comment preservation, atomic write).

## Help
- graph_ap_control(action,
  [lane, text, goal, dir, version, picks, claims, from, to, id, kind, note, model, reasoning_effort, items,
  reviewMode, managerPrompt, managerEnabled, managerIntervalMin, managerUpdateGlobals, confirm, workspace, settings, links]) drive the whole board from the main conversation (lane prompts, trash, collab, recommendations, globals, review mode, steward, catalog, links, settings, status);
- graph_collab_post([text, claims, goal, kind, workspace]) post to the task collab channel and claim resources (conflicts are rejected);
- graph_collab_read([limit, workspace]) read collab messages and active resource claims;
- graph_help() display this help (full 52-tool checklist with parameter reference).

## Claim supervisor
**Execute this only when the person in charge explicitly asks you to take over as supervisor**—by default no session may automatically claim:
1. Old session: graph_handoff() —— generate HANDOFF.md;
2. New session: graph_claim_supervisor() —— update supervisor.session, return full HANDOFF.

The complete supervisor work discipline is in the skill dsh-graph-supervisor; explicitly call it to load.
Principle: deliverables are evidence; proactively transition cards and report status at key stages; throttle heartbeats for long tasks; ask first when uncertain.
